### Hi, I'm Ruwen! 👋🏻

🛠 JavaScript Enthusiast<br/>
📱 Focused on Web & Mobile Development<br/>
🌍 Loves Foreign Languages<br/>

For now more than five years I passionately have been into web development as well as graphic design. I've completed my apprenticeship in media design at the kreativkarussell GmbH in Brilon, Germany.

I love to get to know new technologies and constantly expand on my knowledge. In my spare time I also like to spend time on learning about linguistics, acquiring foreign languages as well as creating music.
